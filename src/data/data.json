I'm looking for a game console I can play at work, and it's come down to the Xbox Series X and the Nintendo Switch. Honestly would have chosen the PS5 but they're like finding a unicorn or a needle in a haystack, so that's out of the question"

It's a great piece of hardware for sure, but if you put in an order now you're likely waiting at least several months if not more than a year, and I suspect most people asking these questions are wondering what's their best option now, not a year from now."
