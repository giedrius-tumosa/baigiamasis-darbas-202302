Honestly would have chosen the PS5 but they're like finding a unicorn or a needle in a haystack, so that's out of the question."

I haven't really looked at games (on any platform) since.\n\nI am now a grown man and decided to fire up my N64 again and I was delighted by the joyful atmosphere of games like Yoshi's Story or Diddy Kong Racing. Everything is just pleasant, ranging from characters' little squeals to butterflies resting on flowers to little frogs that you can drive over and they just bounce back with a cute noise. And of course, the games are FUN. I played them with other adults and we had a blast, very often laughing out loud together.\n\nSo I thought \"wow, I'd love to spend money on the latest generation of gaming consoles now!\""

This isn’t about “PC gamers being wrong,” or “consoles being the best,” absolutely not. I just want to cut through some of the stuff people use to put down console gaming, and show that console gaming is incredibly similar to PC gaming. I mean, yes, this is someone who mainly games on console, but I also am getting a new PC that I will game on as well, not to mention the 30 PC games I already own and play. I’m not particularly partial to one over the other."

It makes sense from a tribalism perspective; consoles are hefty purchases so you need to be able to feel secure that you bought the right one, especially if you're a child as you may not have the funds to secure the competition unless your parents were exceedingly generous. Today's post focuses on one such entry into the console war."
